# Benchmark Results Overview


## Usage

```shell
cd python
sage -python bench.py 
```

**N.B.** The benchmarks are averaged over 1000 instances of the routine. Besides, the endomorphism $\phi$ is not evaluated via (the homogeneous version of) Horner's scheme as proposed in the paper, but more elementarily. Therefore, (GLV based on) $\phi$ is even faster when implemented more properly.

## How to Interpret Results

The benchmark results provide valuable insights into the efficiency of scalar multiplication optimizations. Below are guidelines to help interpret the results:

1. **Execution Time**
  * The results are displayed in milliseconds (ms), indicating the time taken for each operation.
  * Lower values signify better performance.
2. **Percentage Improvement**
 * The percentage improvements demonstrate how much more efficient the optimized solutions (the endomorphism $\phi$ and GLV based on $\phi$) are compared to the double(-and-add) scalar multiplication.
3. **Comparative Context**
 * In the first two lines of each curveâ€™s results, the time of evaluating the endomorphism $\phi$ is compared against that taken to double a point $\ell^\prime = \lceil \ell/2 \rceil$ times, where the value $\ell$ is indicated in the third column of Table 1 from the paper.
 * The second entry compares the standard scalar multiplication against the GLV optimization using $\phi$.
